### Project Contents:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - File: `EDA.ipynb`
   - Overview: This notebook covers the exploration of the dataset, performing initial analysis, visualizations, and identifying patterns or trends. It also includes techniques to handle missing data, detect outliers, and gain insights into the features.
   
2. **Predictive Modeling**
   - File: `PredictiveModelling.ipynb`
   - Overview: This project focuses on building various predictive models using machine learning algorithms. Models like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are implemented. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to compare model performance.

3. **Ensemble Learning**
   - File: `EnsembleLearning.ipynb`
   - Overview: This notebook covers the implementation of various ensemble learning techniques such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Stacking. The goal is to improve the accuracy of the models by combining multiple algorithms. Comparative analysis of the ensemble methods against individual models is also included.
